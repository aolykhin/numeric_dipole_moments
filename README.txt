These tests can be used to compute analytic and numeric permanent (PDM) and transition (TDM) dipole moments.
The numeric values are scanned across set of electric fields, geometries, and on-top functionals. 
The resulting table contains data required to get converged numerical results.


Methods: 
	- state-specific pair-density functional theory (SS-PDFT)
	- state-averaged pair-density functional theory (SA-PDFT) 
	- compresed multi-state pair-density functional theory (CMS-PDFT) 

Numeric PDM:
	- SS-PDFT, SA-PDFT, CMS-PDFT
Numeric TDM:
	- CMS-PDFT

Ultimately these tests will be converged into a single one
